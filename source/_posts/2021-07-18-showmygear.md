I want to share the checklist of hiking gear easily.
Usually I'm one of those "talking without action", anyway, this is how it started,
starting from a high level wireframe.

Look how goofy it is! ðŸ˜‚

## This is how it's going

This is better if you compare it to the first version of wireframe, but everything is still improving.

## Working on a side project is a privilege

I'm so lucky not only to have suggestions from my friends, my colleague from privious job, <a href="http://ruoshin.wang" target="_blank">Ruoshin</a> participates from the beginning, it was such a magical feeling that having the change to make all the goofy ideas come true, discuss and build things democratic.
