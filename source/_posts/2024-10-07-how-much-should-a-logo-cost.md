My friend Denken recently launched the logo design contest for Web3Matters, writing an article titled [“How Much Should a Logo Cost?”](https://substack.com/home/post/p-147821899)

So, how much should it really cost? A logo can either hold no value or be so impactful that it could earn its designer enough to buy a house. A logo is more than just an image; the name behind it is crucial.Take Twitter as example, where ‘tweet’ made posting playful and engaging, shaping the brand’s image

I agree with Brian Chesky: ‘Design is fragile.’ Its impact, positive or negative, often isn’t immediate, unlike programming flaws that cause instant issues.

Though Twitter’s blue bird was ‘killed,’ its designer, Simon Oxley, created another beloved logo: Octocat for GitHub. This quirky octopus-cat hybrid resonated so deeply it inspired fan art, stickers, and toys.

And Simon bought a house with the money from the Twitter bird.

As a struggling designer in Taiwan, I can’t help but feel a bit jealous. But Simon’s story reminds me to focus on what I love: just make the thing I wish it exist.

# My Thoughts on Web3

I’m not a Web3 believer, but I guess that’s okay. Based on my impression, people in the Web3 and crypto are open-minded. After all, they want to disrupt traditional banking and fiat currencies.

Web3 is full of debates, and the line between nonsense and pioneering is often blurred. However, Web3 has also introduced new design styles that traditional businesses would never adopt, giving it an edgy vibe.

When designing the logo for Web3Matters, the only question on my mind is: Is it weird enough? 😉
